MDRotor
=======

MDRotor is rotor-machine for hash reversal.  Or in other words,
it's bruteforce cracker for cryptographic hashes.

Goal is mostly hardware benchmarking, thus it does not have
any dict-based logic.  For more practical cracking
use John the Ripper.

It supports MD5, SHA1, SHA224/256/384/512 algorithms.


TODO
----

- custom start point
- remove hash from map if found
- test mode that walk all engines
- instead 1 char per thread, use 2 or (len - 5) chars
  - alt: assign stacks sequentially

- remove global shared data
- prefix / suffix
- session file
